1,greeting,1_g,"Welcome to superhero self-talk skill training, for the next five day, you are going to have a wonderful adventure with our superhero Zip! Let’s join him to save the world;
Today is our first day joining our superhero Zip. Let’s see how he will lead us to a new adventure!",na-0,"Sorry, can you say again?"
1,0,1_0,"If you are ready, say I am ready to start day one and press the button.",dayone-1,"Sorry, can you say again?"
1,1,1_1,"Great, let's join our superhero Zip now. 
And, first, I would love to get to know you a bit more! Can you tell me your name? ",na-2,"Sorry, can you tell me your name?"
1,2,1_2,"Hi, it’s nice to meet you! 
For the next several days, I am going to tell you a different story every day about a Superhero named Zip. During the story, I will ask you some questions. When you hear the sound [Q effect sound],a question is coming. Sometimes, when I ask you a question, I will ask you to talk about it with your sibling. Now let’s start to have a try to answer one question.",na-3,"Sorry, I did not catch that. Can you say again?"
1,3,1_3,"[Q effect sound]: have you ever faced any challenges, like being picked on, failing a quiz, or getting injured? You can share the experience with me if you have.  Answer ""not sure"" if you cannot think of one right now. Remember to press the button after you have finished sharing. ",na-4,"Sorry, I did not catch that. Can you say again?"
1,4,1_4,"Thanks for sharing that with me! Today we are going to talk about how to deal with challenges using your powerful superhero skill, called superhero self-talk! It is called superhero self-talk because it can help you deal with challenges and fix problems!",na-5,"Sorry, I did not catch that. Can you say again?"
1,5,1_5,"Self-talk is what you say to yourself in your mind every minute of every day. How you talk to yourself changes how you feel, and how you feel changes what you do. Sometimes we talk to ourselves in supportive ways that help us be our best selves, and sometimes we talk to ourselves in hurtful or unproductive ways that make it harder to be our best selves. Our superhero Zip’s super power is that he is great at remembering to talk to himself in a supportive way. With practice, you can build this super power, too! It won’t make problems go away, but it can help you feel more prepared to tackle whatever comes your way. For example, if you are afraid or anxious, you can say to yourself, ""It’s okay, I can handle it, I can do this.” By talking to yourself in a supportive way, you can prepare yourself to cope with challenges and to do your best, even when things are difficult. If you think negatively, it can make you feel even more upset than you already were. You can learn to use self-talk when things go wrong and to be your own self-talk Superhero!",na-6,"Sorry, I did not catch that. Can you say again?"
1,6,1_6,"Now let’s see how Zip uses his super power to help a kid named Lily!
Every night, Zip puts on his mask and cape and flies help someone who is feeling down or frustrated. Zip remembers how to use self-talk with four secret letters: H, T, F, D. “H” is for “happens,” first something that happens. Next, “T” is for “thoughts,” whenever something happens to us, we have thoughts about it. Then comes “F” for feelings. Our thoughts affect our feelings. This is where self-talk comes in! Using self-talk to change how we think about what happens to us changes how we feel about it. And finally “D” is for “do” because our feelings help us decide what to do. Now we can listen to Zip help Lily use self-talk to think-feel-do.",na-7,
1,7,1_7,"It was a Friday night. Lily had just created an epic lego tower covered in missile launchers. Her little sister, Monica, came over to check out Lily’s work and was so excited. “Wow, this is the coolest tower ever!” Without asking Lily for permission, Monica reached out to try launching the missiles and accidentally knocked over the tower, breaking the entire building. Lily watched all her hard work disappear in an instant. She could feel anger rising up inside her. At the same moment, the archenemy of superhero, the supervillain, Hex, was waiting in the shadows, and he cackled with delight when he saw Lily’s frustration. This was his chance! Hex’s evil power is planting seeds of doubt and fear in children’s minds and tricking them into telling themselves hurtful and unsupportive things. Once Hex has tricked a child into undermining themselves, they start to do his evil work for him. When he saw Lily’s anger, he saw a perfect opportunity. He flew to her shoulder and whispered quietly in her ear:",na-8,
,,1_8,"""You spent so long building your legos and she just ruined it! She never respects your things. You should scream at her to teach her a lesson. Why should you always be the one to stay calm? You should throw a fit because you are so mad! She made you feel bad, so you deserve a chance to make her feel bad, too"". Lily’s face began to turn red. Hex saw Lily was getting really angry. He heard her muttering to herself, “I should make her feel bad.” Once Hex heard that he had tricked her into negative self-talk, he gleefully flew away. ",na-9,
,,1_9,"In her mind, Lily kept telling herself that her sister was trying to make her angry. Our positive superhero Zip discovered Lily was getting mad so he quickly flew to her side. Zip said to Lily, “'Hang on, why don't you work on helping yourself feel better before you decide what to do next. Let's take three deep breaths and then think about options.",na-10,
,,1_10,"Let’s take three deep breaths together with Lily to help her feel calm. Let’s count together, ready, go. one breath [pause], two breath [pause], three breath. ",na-11,
,,1_11,"Zip continued, “Now let's try some supportive self-talk. and see how it can help you.
First, notice how you feel right now, and remind yourself that no matter how you’re feeling, it's ok to feel that way.' ",na-12,
,,1_12,[Q effect sound] How do you think Lily feels? Remember to press the button after you have finished sharing. ,na-13,
,,1_13,"That’s a great guess. Let’s see what Lily says. 
Lily told Zip, “I’m feeling so angry! I was really proud of that lego tower and excited to play with it, and now it’s gone.”
Zip said to Lily: 'That makes a lot of sense. Don’t forget that our thoughts change how we feel, and our feelings change what we do, so I want you to talk to yourself in way that will help you decide what to think, feel, and do. You can remember this with the letters, T, F, D! Now, you can say something to yourself like, 'My sister undid a lot of my hard and great work, and I am so frustrated! I know it's ok to be frustrated, but I also know I want to be someone who can handle frustration well.”",na-14,
,,1_14,"Lily decided to listen to Zip. Even though she didn’t like what had happened to her Lego tower, she wanted to feel good about herself and choose to do things she felt proud of. So she tried out self-talk and said quietly to herself, “t’s ok. I feel disappointed, but I can build another tower. Monica did this by accident and I want to be a good role model who shows her how to make things right when she makes a mistake.”
So she went to her sister Monica and said, “Monica, I know it was an accident. But I feel really sad that you broke my lego building. I spent hours building it. I hope you can understand how I feel.”

But Monica didn’t like hearing about her sister’s frustration. Monica knew it was just an accident, and she wanted to defend herself. Just as she was about to yell at Lily, Zip flew to her and sat on her right shoulder. He said, “Monica, let’s wait a second before confronting your sister. I know you didn’t like hearing what she said, and you can’t change what happened, but you can change what you think, feel, and do. Let’s try some supportive self-talk. What do you feel right now?”",na-15,
,,1_15,[Q effect sound] How do you think Monica feels? Press the button after you have finished sharing. ,na-16,
,,1_16,"Thanks for sharing, let’s see how Zip continued helping Monica to deal with her feeling. 

Zip continued, “now feel that feeling and think about what kind of sister you want to be.” Monica said quietly to Zip, “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister”. Zip replied, “That sounds like really good self-talk; do you want to try saying that to yourself three times?” Monica said out loud: 
 “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister” [pause],  
 “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister” [pause]. 
 “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister”. 
“Great job,” said Zip. “So now what do you want to say to your sister about her legos?”",na-17,
,,1_17,"Monica took a deep breath and said to Lily, “Sorry, I accidently broke your lego building. I don’t like the feeling I have when I make you upset. I was just reminding myself that I want to be a good friend and a good sister to you; can we work together to build another building? Maybe we can make a Star Wars ship together!” 
Lily felt her anger evaporate. She and Monica spent half the day building a new lego starship together and had a great time. And in the back of her mind, Lily knew she had a new tool to help her with any chllenge: H-T-F-D. No matter what happens, Lily can talk to herself about her thoughts, which can change her feelings and help her decide what to do. As Zip, he smiled to himself, knowing Lily was now prepared for all that lay ahead.",na-18,
