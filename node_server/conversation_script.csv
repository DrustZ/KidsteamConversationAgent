1,2,1_2,"Hi, it’s nice to meet you! 
For the next several days, I am going to tell you a different story every day about a Superhero named Zip. During the story, I will ask you some questions. When you hear the sound [Q effect sound],a question is coming. Sometimes, when I ask you a question, I will ask you to talk about it with your sibling. Now let’s start to have a try to answer one question. 
[Q effect sound]: have you ever faced any challenges, like being picked on, failing a quiz, or getting injured? You can share the experience with me if you have.  Answer ""not sure"" if you cannot think of one right now. Remember to press the button after you have finished sharing. 
",na-3,recovery
1,3,1_3,"Thanks for sharing that with me! Today we are going to talk about how to deal with challenges using your powerful superhero skill, called superhero self-talk! It is called superhero self-talk because it can help you deal with challenges and fix problems!
Self-talk is what you say to yourself in your mind every minute of every day. How you talk to yourself changes how you feel, and how you feel changes what you do. Sometimes we talk to ourselves in supportive ways that help us be our best selves, and sometimes we talk to ourselves in hurtful or unproductive ways that make it harder to be our best selves. Our superhero Zip’s super power is that he is great at remembering to talk to himself in a supportive way. With practice, you can build this super power, too! It won’t make problems go away, but it can help you feel more prepared to tackle whatever comes your way. For example, if you are afraid or anxious, you can say to yourself, ""It’s okay, I can handle it, I can do this.” By talking to yourself in a supportive way, you can prepare yourself to cope with challenges and to do your best, even when things are difficult. If you think negatively, it can make you feel even more upset than you already were. You can learn to use self-talk when things go wrong and to be your own self-talk Superhero!
Now let’s see how Zip uses his super power to help a kid named Lily!
Every night, Zip puts on his mask and cape and flies help someone who is feeling down or frustrated. Zip remembers how to use self-talk with four secret letters: H, T, F, D. “H” is for “happens,” first something that happens. Next, “T” is for “thoughts,” whenever something happens to us, we have thoughts about it. Then comes “F” for feelings. Our thoughts affect our feelings. This is where self-talk comes in! Using self-talk to change how we think about what happens to us changes how we feel about it. And finally “D” is for “do” because our feelings help us decide what to do. Now we can listen to Zip help Lily use self-talk to think-feel-do.
It was a Friday night. Lily had just created an epic lego tower covered in missile launchers. Her little sister, Monica, came over to check out Lily’s work and was so excited. “Wow, this is the coolest tower ever!” Without asking Lily for permission, Monica reached out to try launching the missiles and accidentally knocked over the tower, breaking the entire building. Lily watched all her hard work disappear in an instant. She could feel anger rising up inside her. At the same moment, the archenemy of superhero, the supervillain, Hex, was waiting in the shadows, and he cackled with delight when he saw Lily’s frustration. This was his chance! Hex’s evil power is planting seeds of doubt and fear in children’s minds and tricking them into telling themselves hurtful and unsupportive things. Once Hex has tricked a child into undermining themselves, they start to do his evil work for him. When he saw Lily’s anger, he saw a perfect opportunity. He flew to her shoulder and whispered quietly in her ear:

Once Hex has tricked a child into undermining themselves, they start to do his evil work for him. When he saw Lily’s anger, he saw a perfect opportunity. He flew to her shoulder and whispered quietly in her ear:
""You spent so long building your legos and she just ruined it! She never respects your things. You should scream at her to teach her a lesson. Why should you always be the one to stay calm? You should throw a fit because you are so mad! She made you feel bad, so you deserve a chance to make her feel bad, too"". Lily’s face began to turn red. Hex saw Lily was getting really angry. He heard her muttering to herself, “I should make her feel bad.” Once Hex heard that he had tricked her into negative self-talk, he gleefully flew away.
In her mind, Lily kept telling herself that her sister was trying to make her angry. Our positive superhero Zip discovered Lily was getting mad so he quickly flew to her side. Zip said to Lily, “'Hang on, why don't you work on helping yourself feel better before you decide what to do next. Let's take three deep breaths and then think about options.
Let’s take three deep breaths together with Lily to help her feel calm. Let’s count together, ready, go. one breath, two breath, three breath. 
Zip continued, “Now let's try some supportive self-talk. and see how it can help you.
First, notice how you feel right now, and remind yourself that no matter how you’re feeling, it's ok to feel that way.' 
[Q effect sound] How do you think Lily feels? Remember to press the button after you have finished sharing. ",na-4,recovery
1,4,1_4,"That’s a great guess. Let’s see what Lily says. 
Lily told Zip, “I’m feeling so angry! I was really proud of that lego tower and excited to play with it, and now it’s gone.”
Zip said to Lily: 'That makes a lot of sense. Don’t forget that our thoughts change how we feel, and our feelings change what we do, so I want you to talk to yourself in way that will help you decide what to think, feel, and do. You can remember this with the letters, T, F, D! Now, you can say something to yourself like, 'My sister undid a lot of my hard and great work, and I am so frustrated! I know it's ok to be frustrated, but I also know I want to be someone who can handle frustration well.”
Lily decided to listen to Zip. Even though she didn’t like what had happened to her Lego tower, she wanted to feel good about herself and choose to do things she felt proud of. So she tried out self-talk and said quietly to herself, “t’s ok. I feel disappointed, but I can build another tower. Monica did this by accident and I want to be a good role model who shows her how to make things right when she makes a mistake.”
So she went to her sister Monica and said, “Monica, I know it was an accident. But I feel really sad that you broke my lego building. I spent hours building it. I hope you can understand how I feel.”

But Monica didn’t like hearing about her sister’s frustration. Monica knew it was just an accident, and she wanted to defend herself. Just as she was about to yell at Lily, Zip flew to her and sat on her right shoulder. He said, “Monica, let’s wait a second before confronting your sister. I know you didn’t like hearing what she said, and you can’t change what happened, but you can change what you think, feel, and do. Let’s try some supportive self-talk. What do you feel right now?”
[Q effect sound] How do you think Monica feels? Press the button after you have finished sharing. ",na-5,recovery
1,5,1_5,"Thanks for sharing, let’s see how Zip continued helping Monica to deal with her feeling. 

Zip continued, “now feel that feeling and think about what kind of sister you want to be.” Monica said quietly to Zip, “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister”. Zip replied, “That sounds like really good self-talk; do you want to try saying that to yourself three times?” Monica said out loud: 
 “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister” [pause],  
 “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister” [pause]. 
 “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister”. 
“Great job,” said Zip. “So now what do you want to say to your sister about her legos?”

Monica took a deep breath and said to Lily, “Sorry, I accidently broke your lego building. I don’t like the feeling I have when I make you upset. I was just reminding myself that I want to be a good friend and a good sister to you; can we work together to build another building? Maybe we can make a Star Wars ship together!” 
Lily felt her anger evaporate. She and Monica spent half the day building a new lego starship together and had a great time. And in the back of her mind, Lily knew she had a new tool to help her with any chllenge: H-T-F-D. No matter what happens, Lily can talk to herself about her thoughts, which can change her feelings and help her decide what to do. As Zip, he smiled to himself, knowing Lily was now prepared for all that lay ahead.

2,3,2_3,"“Thanks for sharing! Now, let’s move on to hear how superhero helped the Wizard Acanemy student Lucy”

“Every year at the Wizarding Prepatory Academy, there was a potion-making exam that the junior Wizards must take to be able to move onto the next level of potion master training. Every junior Wizard must be able to create a potion that turns a frog into a bouquet of beautiful flowers. But Lucy, a junior Wizard at the academy, was struggling to master potion-making. She had been practicing for weeks; she had read every potion book she could find and followed the directions perfectly. But every time she combined the ingredients in her cauldron, cast the spell from her spellbook, and tested the potion on a frog, she turned the frog into something horrible like a stinky fish, a fat worm, or ugly rat! ”

2,4,2_4,"“Good thinking. Let’s see if that’s what Lucy does!” 
“A few days before the exam, Lucy was practicing her potion skills. After hours of practice with no success, she concentrated as hard as she could, carefully measured her ingredients, and turned the frog into… a bar of ice cream! She felt tears of frustration welling up in her eyes. She told herself, ‘This is hopeless, I just have to accept that I am terrible at making potions. I will never get this right and should just give up!’ Just as she was about to go back to her dormitory and cry, she heard a loud “Whoosh” and suddenly, a mini superhero Zip was standing on her right shoulder!”

Zip said, “Hey Lucy, what do you feel right now?” Lucy replied, “Whoa, who are you?” Lucy exclaimed. “I don’t know how you knew to ask, but I feel SO frustrated. I have tried to make this potion work so many times, and I just can’t. I am starting to wonder if I am good enough to be a wizard at all.” Zip explained that self-talk could help Lucy decide what to think about the things that happen to her, that those thoughts would influence her feelings, and that how she feels will help guide her in deciding what to do. 

Zip continued, “So let’s start with ‘H,’ tell me about what happened.”
“Well,” said Lucy, “I have tried and tried and tried to get this potion right, but every time I say the magic words–poof–my frog turns into just about anything other than a bouquet of flowers. Right now it’s an ice cream bar!”
“I see,” said Zip. “And that’s why you’re feeling so frustrated? And even starting to think some unproductive things–like thinking that you should give up and will never be a wizard?”
Lucy hung her head and nodded glumly.
“Ok,” said Zip, “here’s some magic I want you to try. Together, let’s think of some things you can say to yourself that are supportive and compassionate. Here’s one: ‘I’m proud of myself for trying so hard.’”
Lucy thought to herself for a moment and then said, “I guess… I’m happy because I can eat an ice cream bar?”

Zip laughed and said, “Well, that’s probably true, but let’s see if you can think of something more supportive than that. What can you tell yourself that can help you feel ready to move forward and help you know what to do next?”
Lucy thought some more, then said “Ok, how about this one: ‘It’s great that I’m trying hard and it’s ok not to succeed at first. Lots of new wizards even need help from a teacher when they’re first starting out.”
“Wow!” said Zip, “That is some seriously magical self-talk! And it sounds like you’re already starting to think about what to do next. Here’s an idea: what do you think about asking someone for help?”
[Q effect sound] [SEL Question]: “What do you think about Zip’s idea? Press the button after you have finished sharing to continue. ",na-5,recovery
2,5,2_5,"“Thanksfor sharing, let’s see what Lucy thinks.”

Lucy told Zip that she was embarrassed to ask for help. She worried the professors or her friends would think she was not smart if she couldn’t learn it all on her own.

Zip nodded with understanding. “He said, “sometimes negative thoughts and feelings like that can crowd out the helpful ones. It’s easy to say things to yourself like, ‘I can’t do this. I am not smart enough. People will laugh at me if I ask for their help.’ But those negative thoughts will change how you feel and what you do. And when that voice in your head is telling you unsupportive things, challenges that are already tough become even harder! 

Instead, try talking to yourself with all of the compassion and support you can muster. What can you say that will help you feel prepared to keep going? Now, what was that you said earlier about a lot of new wizards needing to ask for help?” Zip winked at Lucy and said, “I think you were just about to say that asking for help not a sign of failure or a weakness, it takes a lot of courage and is an important part of life.”

Lucy kept practicing her self-talk and by the next day, she had worked up the courage to ask  her potions professor, Danielle, for help. Her professor watched her try out the spell and pointed out three key mistakes along the way. Once Lucy knew what to focus on, her hard work started to pay off. She still needed practice, but after accidentally making herself a few frustrating–but delicious–ice cream bars, Lucy finally created a beautiful bouquet of flowers!

2,6,2_6,"“Good guess. After finally passing her potion exam, Lucy felt glad she had asked for help and proud of accomplishing something new that had been difficult for her. But the thing Lucy felt most proud of was talking herself into trying again and asking for help. Supportive self-talk gave her the boost she needed to feel better, even when things weren’t going well, and think of something productive to try next.”

We have finished today’s story. I have some questions for you to reflect and discuss with your siblings. First question,
[Q effect sound] [SEL Question]: “Now we’ve heard Lily tell herself to be patient with her sister, Monica tell herself to take the hard step of apologizing after making a mistake, and Lucy telling herself that she should keep trying, even when the task at hand seemed impossible.

“Thanks for listening to today’s story and learning a new skill of asking for help. Like yesterday, we will have a take home question that I will ask one of you to answer before tomorrow’s story! The question is: “What are some reasons why people should not be afraid to ask for help?”

Today we are going to hear about how Zip helps two siblings handle their frustration after an argument. Nina and her younger brother Noah have a special ability that runs in their family: they turn into goblins whenever they become extremely angry! Let’s move on to our story. 

One day, Noah kept going into Nina’s room to borrow her special quill pen because he wanted to draw with it. Nina kept yelling at him to go away because she worked hard to save up for the quill and didn’t want anyone using it. “NOAH STOP COMING INTO MY ROOM! YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR OWN QUILLS TO DRAW WITH,” she screamed.

Noah didn’t like being yelled at and got really angry. He transformed into a goblin and started shrieking and causing a mess. He threw things around and began to jump ups and downs on Nina’s bed. This made Nina lose her patience and she also transformed into a goblin.

3,5,3_5,"Zip noticed the commotion and decided to see what was going on. Instead of using his super strength to fight the goblins, he decided to fix the situation by letting each sibling explain their side of the story. “Hey! What’s going on?” he asked.

Nina said, “Noah kept going into my room to take my quill even though I kept saying no so I yelled at him!”. 
Noah snapped back, “I wanted to use her quill because they were cooler than mine. But she kept screaming at me and I got so mad!”

Zip noticed their anger and said, “Wow, you two are just yelling hurtful things at each other and it is causing you two to become goblins! I know this is hard but I want you two to use supportive self-talk. First, let’s examine how you are feeling and also imagine how the other feel during the fight. Remember, when we feel angry with someone, we  we should use superhero self-talk skills and take three deep breath first.”

“One breath, two breath, three breath” [breath sound effect]

Nina then said quietly to herself “When Noah take my stuff even though I said no for many times, I feel annoyed because Noah are not listening to me and respecting my stuff. It’s ok to feel frustrated but I also want to be a good sister and not make the situation worse.” Nina thought for a while and decided to tell Noah how she felt,”I feel annoyed because you are not respecting me. If you really need my quill, I can lend it to you. We can ask our Dad to buy us more later.”

[Q Effect Sound][Learning Question] Now it’s your turn to be creative. How would Noah use self-talk to help him? Press the button after you have finished sharing to continue. ",na-6,recovery
3,6,3_6,"Noah told Nina, “I don’t like being yelled at and I just wanted you to share with me. When you do that, I get really mad and sad because I think it is unfair. If you had said it nicely, I would not being that mad and turned into a goblin. I agree that we can ask our Dad to buy more quills for both of us later.”

Zip explained that it is important to recognize when you feel angry and talk to the person about why you feel angry instead of blowing up at them. And it is also important to use self-talk to check your emitons, take a deep breath, and tell yourself what kind of person you want to be before act.  So after talking out their feelings despite being upset, Nina and Noah transformed back into humans. 

Finally,  they worked out their argument. Nina agreed to lend her quill to Noah. After that they asked their Dad to buy more quills to use in the future. They were both happy about the results thanks to the help from our superhero Zip.

Today we are going to continue the story of our superhero Zip and see if he can help Juno, the youngest sibling in the Umbra family to overcome her self-doubt using supportive self-talk.

Before we start our new journey, I have a question for you. [Question effect sound] Have you ever felt a lack of confidence?  After you have finished sharing, press the button to continue. ",na-3,recovery
4,3,4_3,"Thanks for sharing with me. We all sometimes feel a lack of confidenceespecially when we start learning a new skill, need to perform well or pass a exam, or face new changes. Today we are going to see how Zip helps Juno confront her self-doubt using supportive self-talk.  
Juno came from a family of famous swordsmiths, the legendary Umbra family. She wanted to learn the family craft of making majestic swords, so that she could carry on the family legacy. Their swords were used in epic battles against dragons and supervillains. However, sword making did not come easily to her. Juno had a lot of trouble creating strong swords. The ones she made were either too small, too weak, or not comfortable to use in battle. 
One day when Juno was working, our supervillain Hex noticed her inside the workshop and saw the weak sword she was working on. He said “Hey, aren’t you the youngest member of the Umbra family?” She looked up in surprise; she didn’t even know anyone had been watching her. Before Juno could answer, Hex continued: “So the rumors are true! You really are terrible at making swords; you’re even worse than I imagined! You’ll never live up to your family name.” Hex’s words hit Juno like an arrow to her heart. She looked straight down at the sword she was working on, scrubbing it furiously with a steel wool polishing cloth, hoping Hex wouldn’t see that her lip was trembling. She thought about her older sister Alvina and her older brothers Eris and Clem and the powerful, elegant swords–with impossibly thin blades and jewel-encrusted hilts–that they turned out day after day. She had never made anything like that, and a lump rose in her throat thinking about Hex’s words. “He’s right, she told herself. I’ll never be able to do that.”Hex grinned to himself watching Juno on the verge of tears. He didn’t know what she was thinking, but he felt sure negative self-talk was setting in. He laughed evily and flew away.

Fortunately, Zip had been tracking Hex, knowing he was up to no good. When saw Hex fly off, he knew trouble had to be brewing nearby. After searching carefully in every nook and cranny, Zip finally spotted a sniffling Juno.

“Hey there,” Zip said gently, “I just saw an acquaintance of mine named Hex fly out of here. I hate to say it, but he has a bad habit of getting kids to use negative self-talk. You didn’t notice him doing that here, did you?”

“Negative self-talk?” Juno replied. “What’s that?” 

“Ah,” said Zip, “Negative self-talk is a very sneaky trickster. It is all the things we tell ourselves that make us feel hopeless and sad. It can creep into our minds when we least expect it and ruin good moments and make bad moments harder. Is there any chance you’ve been talking to yourself negatively?”

Juno let out a sob of frustration as the dam inside her broke and all her thoughts came tumbling out. “I’ve been telling myself that everyone in my family but me can make beautiful swords, and I’m going to be an embarrassment to my whole family. I’ve been telling myself that I am awful at this and it’s only a matter of time before everyone else finds out! But that’s not negative self-talk” she went on, “that’s just the truth!”

Zip smiled sympathetically. “I know just how you feel, and I know you have a big challenge ahead of you to master your family craft. But what happens next depends on you and what you decide to do. What you tell yourself will affect how you think, how you feel, what you do–and even what those swords look like. So tell me this, what does it take to become a masterful swordmaker?”

“I dunno,” Juno said sullenly. “Years of practice and hard work. Good teachers. Careful stone-setting techniques. The finest tools. Steady fingers and a sharp eye. All things I don’t have!”

“That’s a great list!” said Zip. “And you may be right–perhaps you haven’t had the years of practice and hard work that it takes to develop those steady fingers and sharp eyes. But I’m proud of you for being right here in this workshop where that practice and hard work can begin. I know you have the motivation to build this skill, but I think you need some positive self-talk, too. So, instead of telling yourself, ‘I am awful at this and it’s only a matter of time before everyone else finds out,’ I want you to say, ‘I am awful at this and it’s only a matter of time before I get better. I have faith that if I practice, work hard, and watch what the experts do, I will become an expert myself.”

Although Juno gradually started to feel better, the story doesn’t end there. When supervillain Hex discovered that his plans had been foiled, he became enraged. “This is the last time Zip will talk to one of these sniveling children,” Hex swore to himself. “I know the mountain where he sleeps, and when he wakes tomorrow, he’s going to be in for quite a surprise.”
Tomorrow in our final chapter, we’ll find out if Hex is successful in his plot of revenge. But today, I have a few last questions for you. 
[Q Effect Sound]  Think about the things that you are struggling with. Can one of you share one thing you want to tell yourself when you’re thinking about this challenge?  After you have finished sharing, press the button to continue.
",na-5,recovery
4,5,4_5,"Thanks for sharing. Remember we all face challenges in our lives. But how we talk to ourselves will influence our attitudes toward the challenges. If when we have challenges we remember to use supportive self-talk, even if the challenges are still there, we will have courage and confidence to face them. You can tell yourself, “All I need to do is try my best. If it doesn’t work, I’ll still be proud of myself for trying, and I’ll have a chance to try again in the future”. That will carry you through difficulties and challenges. 
Before we end our day’s story. I want to leave you a take home question: 
How do you think being persistent and confident can affect your life?

Think about this question, and I will ask one of you to share with me during tomorrow's story time.

5,1,5_1,"Welcome back to our superhero vs. supervillain story. I hope you’re excited to hear our final installment today–what will happen with Zip and Hex face each other at last? Before we find out, let’s revisit our question from yesterday.
Yesterday I asked, [Question Effect Sound] “How do you think being persistent and confident can affect your life?” Can you tell me what you think? After you have finished sharing, press the button to continue. ",na-2,recovery
5,2,5_2,"Thanks for sharing; those are great insights. And now without further do, let’s see how things end for our superhero Zip.
When Hex arrived on the mountaintop, he found himself enveloped by a cold, dense fog. “Zip sleeps here??” he thought to himself, “how strange.”

The fog blocked his view in every direction, yet Hex instinctively crouched low to avoid being seen. He crept forward slowly with his arms outstretched, hoping to feel his way through the blinding fog. He clambered up and around giant boulders and inched his way past steep crags. At last, his hands felt what he had been hoping to find: the entrance to Zip’s cave.

Meanwhile, Zip slept peacefully in his secret cave, dreaming of Juno and Lily, Nina and Monica, Noah and Lucy, and all the other children he had watched become kinder and stronger that week. As he breathed gently in and out, he suddenly sat bolt upright–something was amiss! He felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up and every nerve in his body was alert. What was wrong? Was someone there? He glanced from side to side, shaking sleep from his eyes, but all he could see in every direction was a thick, cold fog. 

He heard nothing, saw nothing. Perhaps he had been mistaken. Zip sighed and started to lay down again. “I must be miscalibrated,” he said to himself. “Too many adventures and too much excitement lately.” 

But before he could pull the blankets back over him, Hex burst into view. “I’VE GOT YOU NOW!” he shouted. “GIVE UP, ZIP; YOU’RE OUT OF OPTIONS!”

Zip instantly snapped into action, leaping from his bed to full engagement in a fraction of a second, hovering above the ground with his fists up. “I should have known it was you,” he said. “But you can’t catch me off guard that easily.”

“OH CAN’T I?” Hex retorted, whipping out a can of smelly spray and frantically spraying Zip who began hacking and coughing and waving his arms. “Ugh, Hex! What is that?? It’s horrid!”

“HAHA!” said Hex. “I know it is! It’s my seriously stupendous smelltacular stink spray, and now it’s all over YOU! Now NO children will want to be anywhere near you!”


[Question Effect Sound]: Now Zip is covered in Hex’s putrid potion. What do you think he’ll do to get himself out of this mess?

5,3,5_3,"Great guess, let’s see if Zip thinks of that. 

“Hex,” Zip sighed, “why don’t you want me to teach children about supportive self-talk? And why do you teach them to tell themselves hurtful things?”

Hex pulled out his smelly spray angrily and looked like he was about to deploy it again. But just as he was about to press the nozzle, he let his arm fall down to his side in defeat. To Zip’s surprise, he saw Hex’s eyes filling with tears. 

“EVERYONE THINKS YOU’RE BETTER THAN ME!” Hex spluttered. “You’ve always been the better superhero: faster, stronger, better at self-talk. No one will ever want to be around me if they notice they could have you as their superhero instead. So if they don’t want me, I don’t want them to have any super hero at all! They can just be stuck being sad about their problems just like I’m stuck being sad about mine!

[Question Effect Sound] What do you think Zip and Hex are each feeling right now? After you have finished sharing, press the button to continue. ",na-4,recovery
5,4,5_4,"Thanks for sharing, let’s see if that’s what Hex and Zip say, too. 

“Hex,” said Zip quietly, “you have so many amazing talents. You’re probably the stealthiest super hero I know. Just this morning, you crept up on my so quietly that I had convinced myself no one was here and was about to go back to bed. This smelly spray is–unfortunately–the most potent brew I’ve ever encountered. Any kid would be lucky to have you as their super hero, if you just cared about helping them.

Hex sniffed and looked up at Zip. “You think I’m stealthy?” he said quietly.

“Totally!” replied Zip. “There are so many things I could learn from you. I wish my super hero family could see your moves.”

Hex kicked at a loose rock on the ground and looked down at his feet. “Your family wouldn’t care about my abilities,” he mumbled. “They’re all amazing super heroes already; what would they see in me? You’re so lucky you even have a family; I have no one.”

“Hex!” Zip said in exasperation. “I think you’ve spent so much time teaching kids negative self-talk that now it’s all you know! Are you kidding me? My family loves meeting and learning about new superheroes. If you can just change your attitude and decide that you want to support other people and yourself, I think they’d love to get to know you. They live in a small house on the other side of the mountain, with flowers, horses, cows, and other cute animals. Why don’t we take a trip together and stay with them for a while? But–you’ll have to stop spraying people with smelly spray!”

Hex wiped the tears from his eyes. “Thanks, Zip” he said quietly. “I’m so embarrassed that I came up here to spray you. I’d love to meet your family, but honestly, I don’t see how I can face them after what I’ve done.”

Zip smiled. “I know how you feel. But I think you can do it. Let’s try the same positive self-talk that helps kids. How about telling yourself something like, ‘It’s never too late to change the way I treat people. If I show others that I care about them, there’s a good chance they’ll care about me, too.’”

[Question Effect Sound]  What are the four letters that Zip can teach Hex to help him get better at self-talk? After you have finished sharing, press the button to continue.",na-5,recovery
5,5,5_5,"Thanks for your guess. Hex can use H for “happens,” T for “thoughts,” F for “feelings,” and D for “do” to help guide him through self-talk.

Positive self-talk didn’t come easily for Hex at first–he was out of practice. But with time, practice, and encouragement from Zip, he eventually became a master. Today he lives on Zip’s family farm, where he grows herbs and wildflowers that he uses to make magical potions. And every afternoon, Hex and Zip search as a team for kids who might need a little encouragement to practice self-talk, too.

But the best part of all, is that you don’t need to wait for Zip and Hex to visit. Every kid has a superhero inside them that can help you be your best self in good times and in bad. So don’t forget to call on your superhero self every day; they are right there inside you just waiting to help you thrive.
