1,2,1_2,"Hi, it’s nice to meet you! 
For the next several days, I am going to tell you a different story every day about a Superhero named Zip. During the story, I will ask you some questions. When you hear the sound [Q effect sound],a question is coming. Sometimes, when I ask you a question, I will ask you to talk about it with your sibling. Now let’s start to have a try to answer one question. 
[Q effect sound]: have you ever faced any challenges, like being picked on, failing a quiz, or getting injured? You can share the experience with me if you have.  Answer ""not sure"" if you cannot think of one right now. Remember to press the button after you have finished sharing. 
",na-3,recovery
1,3,1_3,"Thanks for sharing that with me! Today we are going to talk about how to deal with challenges using your powerful superhero skill, called superhero self-talk! It is called superhero self-talk because it can help you deal with challenges and fix problems!
Self-talk is what you say to yourself in your mind every minute of every day. How you talk to yourself changes how you feel, and how you feel changes what you do. Sometimes we talk to ourselves in supportive ways that help us be our best selves, and sometimes we talk to ourselves in hurtful or unproductive ways that make it harder to be our best selves. Our superhero Zip’s super power is that he is great at remembering to talk to himself in a supportive way. With practice, you can build this super power, too! It won’t make problems go away, but it can help you feel more prepared to tackle whatever comes your way. For example, if you are afraid or anxious, you can say to yourself, ""It’s okay, I can handle it, I can do this.” By talking to yourself in a supportive way, you can prepare yourself to cope with challenges and to do your best, even when things are difficult. If you think negatively, it can make you feel even more upset than you already were. You can learn to use self-talk when things go wrong and to be your own self-talk Superhero!
Now let’s see how Zip uses his super power to help a kid named Lily!
Every night, Zip puts on his mask and cape and flies help someone who is feeling down or frustrated. Zip remembers how to use self-talk with four secret letters: H, T, F, D. “H” is for “happens,” first something that happens. Next, “T” is for “thoughts,” whenever something happens to us, we have thoughts about it. Then comes “F” for feelings. Our thoughts affect our feelings. This is where self-talk comes in! Using self-talk to change how we think about what happens to us changes how we feel about it. And finally “D” is for “do” because our feelings help us decide what to do. Now we can listen to Zip help Lily use self-talk to think-feel-do.
It was a Friday night. Lily had just created an epic lego tower covered in missile launchers. Her little sister, Monica, came over to check out Lily’s work and was so excited. “Wow, this is the coolest tower ever!” Without asking Lily for permission, Monica reached out to try launching the missiles and accidentally knocked over the tower, breaking the entire building. Lily watched all her hard work disappear in an instant. She could feel anger rising up inside her. At the same moment, the archenemy of superhero, the supervillain, Hex, was waiting in the shadows, and he cackled with delight when he saw Lily’s frustration. This was his chance! Hex’s evil power is planting seeds of doubt and fear in children’s minds and tricking them into telling themselves hurtful and unsupportive things. Once Hex has tricked a child into undermining themselves, they start to do his evil work for him. When he saw Lily’s anger, he saw a perfect opportunity. He flew to her shoulder and whispered quietly in her ear:

Once Hex has tricked a child into undermining themselves, they start to do his evil work for him. When he saw Lily’s anger, he saw a perfect opportunity. He flew to her shoulder and whispered quietly in her ear:
""You spent so long building your legos and she just ruined it! She never respects your things. You should scream at her to teach her a lesson. Why should you always be the one to stay calm? You should throw a fit because you are so mad! She made you feel bad, so you deserve a chance to make her feel bad, too"". Lily’s face began to turn red. Hex saw Lily was getting really angry. He heard her muttering to herself, “I should make her feel bad.” Once Hex heard that he had tricked her into negative self-talk, he gleefully flew away.
In her mind, Lily kept telling herself that her sister was trying to make her angry. Our positive superhero Zip discovered Lily was getting mad so he quickly flew to her side. Zip said to Lily, “'Hang on, why don't you work on helping yourself feel better before you decide what to do next. Let's take three deep breaths and then think about options.
Let’s take three deep breaths together with Lily to help her feel calm. Let’s count together, ready, go. one breath, two breath, three breath. 
Zip continued, “Now let's try some supportive self-talk. and see how it can help you.
First, notice how you feel right now, and remind yourself that no matter how you’re feeling, it's ok to feel that way.' 
[Q effect sound] How do you think Lily feels? Remember to press the button after you have finished sharing. ",na-4,recovery
1,4,1_4,"That’s a great guess. Let’s see what Lily says. 
Lily told Zip, “I’m feeling so angry! I was really proud of that lego tower and excited to play with it, and now it’s gone.”
Zip said to Lily: 'That makes a lot of sense. Don’t forget that our thoughts change how we feel, and our feelings change what we do, so I want you to talk to yourself in way that will help you decide what to think, feel, and do. You can remember this with the letters, T, F, D! Now, you can say something to yourself like, 'My sister undid a lot of my hard and great work, and I am so frustrated! I know it's ok to be frustrated, but I also know I want to be someone who can handle frustration well.”
Lily decided to listen to Zip. Even though she didn’t like what had happened to her Lego tower, she wanted to feel good about herself and choose to do things she felt proud of. So she tried out self-talk and said quietly to herself, “t’s ok. I feel disappointed, but I can build another tower. Monica did this by accident and I want to be a good role model who shows her how to make things right when she makes a mistake.”
So she went to her sister Monica and said, “Monica, I know it was an accident. But I feel really sad that you broke my lego building. I spent hours building it. I hope you can understand how I feel.”

But Monica didn’t like hearing about her sister’s frustration. Monica knew it was just an accident, and she wanted to defend herself. Just as she was about to yell at Lily, Zip flew to her and sat on her right shoulder. He said, “Monica, let’s wait a second before confronting your sister. I know you didn’t like hearing what she said, and you can’t change what happened, but you can change what you think, feel, and do. Let’s try some supportive self-talk. What do you feel right now?”
[Q effect sound] How do you think Monica feels? Press the button after you have finished sharing. ",na-5,recovery
1,5,1_5,"Thanks for sharing, let’s see how Zip continued helping Monica to deal with her feeling. 

Zip continued, “now feel that feeling and think about what kind of sister you want to be.” Monica said quietly to Zip, “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister”. Zip replied, “That sounds like really good self-talk; do you want to try saying that to yourself three times?” Monica said out loud: 
 “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister” [pause],  
 “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister” [pause]. 
 “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister”. 
“Great job,” said Zip. “So now what do you want to say to your sister about her legos?”

Monica took a deep breath and said to Lily, “Sorry, I accidently broke your lego building. I don’t like the feeling I have when I make you upset. I was just reminding myself that I want to be a good friend and a good sister to you; can we work together to build another building? Maybe we can make a Star Wars ship together!” 
Lily felt her anger evaporate. She and Monica spent half the day building a new lego starship together and had a great time. And in the back of her mind, Lily knew she had a new tool to help her with any chllenge: H-T-F-D. No matter what happens, Lily can talk to herself about her thoughts, which can change her feelings and help her decide what to do. As Zip, he smiled to himself, knowing Lily was now prepared for all that lay ahead.

2,2,2_2,"“Thanks for sharing! Now, let’s move on to hear how superhero helped the Wizard Acanemy student Lucy”

“Every year at the Wizarding Prepatory Academy, there was a potion-making exam that the junior Wizards must take to be able to move onto the next level of potion master training. Every junior Wizard must be able to create a potion that turns a frog into a bouquet of beautiful flowers. But Lucy, a junior Wizard at the academy, was struggling to master potion-making. She had been practicing for weeks; she had read every potion book she could find and followed the directions perfectly. But every time she combined the ingredients in her cauldron, cast the spell from her spellbook, and tested the potion on a frog, she turned the frog into something horrible like a stinky fish, a fat worm, or ugly rat! ”

2,3,2_3,"“Good thinking. Let’s see if that’s what Lucy does!” 
“A few days before the exam, Lucy was practicing her potion skills. After hours of practice with no success, she concentrated as hard as she could, carefully measured her ingredients, and turned the frog into… a bar of ice cream! She felt tears of frustration welling up in her eyes. She told herself, ‘This is hopeless, I just have to accept that I am terrible at making potions. I will never get this right and should just give up!’ Just as she was about to go back to her dormitory and cry, she heard a loud “Whoosh” and suddenly, a mini superhero Zip was standing on her right shoulder!”

Zip said, “Hey Lucy, what do you feel right now?” Lucy replied, “Whoa, who are you?” Lucy exclaimed. “I don’t know how you knew to ask, but I feel SO frustrated. I have tried to make this potion work so many times, and I just can’t. I am starting to wonder if I am good enough to be a wizard at all.” Zip explained that self-talk could help Lucy decide what to think about the things that happen to her, that those thoughts would influence her feelings, and that how she feels will help guide her in deciding what to do. 

Zip continued, “So let’s start with ‘H,’ tell me about what happened.”
“Well,” said Lucy, “I have tried and tried and tried to get this potion right, but every time I say the magic words–poof–my frog turns into just about anything other than a bouquet of flowers. Right now it’s an ice cream bar!”
“I see,” said Zip. “And that’s why you’re feeling so frustrated? And even starting to think some unproductive things–like thinking that you should give up and will never be a wizard?”
Lucy hung her head and nodded glumly.
“Ok,” said Zip, “here’s some magic I want you to try. Together, let’s think of some things you can say to yourself that are supportive and compassionate. Here’s one: ‘I’m proud of myself for trying so hard.’”
Lucy thought to herself for a moment and then said, “I guess… I’m happy because I can eat an ice cream bar?”

Zip laughed and said, “Well, that’s probably true, but let’s see if you can think of something more supportive than that. What can you tell yourself that can help you feel ready to move forward and help you know what to do next?”
Lucy thought some more, then said “Ok, how about this one: ‘It’s great that I’m trying hard and it’s ok not to succeed at first. Lots of new wizards even need help from a teacher when they’re first starting out.”
“Wow!” said Zip, “That is some seriously magical self-talk! And it sounds like you’re already starting to think about what to do next. Here’s an idea: what do you think about asking someone for help?”
[Q effect sound] [SEL Question]: “What do you think about Zip’s idea? Press the button after you have finished sharing to continue. ",na-4,recovery
2,4,2_4,"“Thanksfor sharing, let’s see what Lucy thinks.”

Lucy told Zip that she was embarrassed to ask for help. She worried the professors or her friends would think she was not smart if she couldn’t learn it all on her own.

Zip nodded with understanding. “He said, “sometimes negative thoughts and feelings like that can crowd out the helpful ones. It’s easy to say things to yourself like, ‘I can’t do this. I am not smart enough. People will laugh at me if I ask for their help.’ But those negative thoughts will change how you feel and what you do. And when that voice in your head is telling you unsupportive things, challenges that are already tough become even harder! 

Instead, try talking to yourself with all of the compassion and support you can muster. What can you say that will help you feel prepared to keep going? Now, what was that you said earlier about a lot of new wizards needing to ask for help?” Zip winked at Lucy and said, “I think you were just about to say that asking for help not a sign of failure or a weakness, it takes a lot of courage and is an important part of life.”

Lucy kept practicing her self-talk and by the next day, she had worked up the courage to ask  her potions professor, [add name?], for help. Her professor watched her try out the spell and pointed out three key mistakes along the way. Once Lucy knew what to focus on, her hard work started to pay off. She still needed practice, but after accidentally making herself a few frustrating–but delicious–ice cream bars, Lucy finally created a beautiful bouquet of flowers!

2,5,2_5,"“Good guess. After finally passing her potion exam, Lucy felt glad she had asked for help and proud of accomplishing something new that had been difficult for her. But the thing Lucy felt most proud of was talking herself into trying again and asking for help. Supportive self-talk gave her the boost she needed to feel better, even when things weren’t going well, and think of something productive to try next.”",na-6,recovery

“Thanks for listening to today’s story and learning a new skill of asking for help. Like yesterday, we will have a take home question that I will ask one of you to answer before tomorrow’s story! The question is: “What are some reasons why people should not be afraid to ask for help?”

Today we are going to hear about how Zip helps two siblings handle their frustration after an argument. Nina and her younger brother Noah have a special ability that runs in their family: they turn into goblins whenever they become extremely angry! Let’s move on to our story. 

One day, Noah kept going into Nina’s room to borrow her special quill pen because he wanted to draw with it. Nina kept yelling at him to go away because she worked hard to save up for the quill and didn’t want anyone using it. “NOAH STOP COMING INTO MY ROOM! YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR OWN QUILLS TO DRAW WITH,” she screamed.

Noah didn’t like being yelled at and got really angry. He transformed into a goblin and started shrieking and causing a mess. He threw things around and began to jump ups and downs on Nina’s bed. This made Nina lose her patience and she also transformed into a goblin.

3,5,3_5,"Zip noticed the commotion and decided to see what was going on. Instead of using his super strength to fight the goblins, he decided to fix the situation by letting each sibling explain their side of the story. “Hey! What’s going on?” he asked.

Nina said, “Noah kept going into my room to take my quill even though I kept saying no so I yelled at him!”. 
Noah snapped back, “I wanted to use her quill because they were cooler than mine. But she kept screaming at me and I got so mad!”

Zip noticed their anger and said, “Wow, you two are just yelling hurtful things at each other and it is causing you two to become goblins! I know this is hard but I want you two to use supportive self-talk. First, let’s examine how you are feeling and also imagine how the other feel during the fight. Remember, when we feel angry with someone, we  we should use superhero self-talk skills and take three deep breath first.”

“One breath, two breath, three breath” [breath sound effect]

Nina then said quietly to herself “When Noah take my stuff even though I said no for many times, I feel annoyed because Noah are not listening to me and respecting my stuff. It’s ok to feel frustrated but I also want to be a good sister and not make the situation worse.” Nina thought for a while and decided to tell Noah how she felt,”I feel annoyed because you are not respecting me. If you really need my quill, I can lend it to you. We can ask our Dad to buy us more later.”

[Q Effect Sound][Learning Question] Now it’s your turn to be creative. How would Noah use self-talk to help him? Press the button after you have finished sharing to continue. ",na-6,recovery
3,6,3_6,"Noah told Nina, “I don’t like being yelled at and I just wanted you to share with me. When you do that, I get really mad and sad because I think it is unfair. If you had said it nicely, I would not being that mad and turned into a goblin. I agree that we can ask our Dad to buy more quills for both of us later.”

Zip explained that it is important to recognize when you feel angry and talk to the person about why you feel angry instead of blowing up at them. And it is also important to use self-talk to check your emitons, take a deep breath, and tell yourself what kind of person you want to be before act.  So after talking out their feelings despite being upset, Nina and Noah transformed back into humans. 

Finally,  they worked out their argument. Nina agreed to lend her quill to Noah. After that they asked their Dad to buy more quills to use in the future. They were both happy about the results thanks to the help from our superhero Zip.
