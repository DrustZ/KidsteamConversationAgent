1,0,"If you are ready, say I am ready to start day one and press the button",dayone-finish,"Sorry, can you say again?"
1,1,"Great; let's join our superhero Zip now; And, first, I would love to get to know you a bit more! Can you tell me your name? ",na-2,"Sorry, can you tell me your name?"
1,2,"Hi, it’s nice to meet you!; For the next several days, I am going to tell you a different story every day about a Superhero named Zip. During the story, I will ask you some questions. When you hear the sound; [Q effect sound]; a question is coming. Sometimes, when I ask you a question, I will ask you to talk about it with your sibling. Now let’s start; [Q effect sound]; have you ever faced any challenges, like being picked on, failing a quiz, or getting injured? You can share the experience with me if you have; you can answer ""not sure"" if you cannot think of one right now.",na-3,"Sorry, I did not catch that. Can you say again?"
1,3,"Thanks for sharing that with me! Today we are going to talk about how to deal with challenges using your powerful superhero skill, called superhero self-talk! It is called superhero self-talk that can help you deal with challenges and fix problems!; 
Self-talk is what you say to yourself every minute of every day. Sometimes we talk to ourselves in supportive ways that help us be our best selves, and sometimes we talk to ourselves in hurtful or unproductive ways that make it harder to be our best selves. Our superhero Zip’s super power is that he is great at remembering to talk to himself in a supportive way. With practice, you can build this super power, too! It won’t make problems go away, but it can help you feel more prepared to tackle whatever comes your way. For example, if you are afraid or anxious, you can say to yourself, ""It’s okay, I can handle it, I can do this.” By talking to yourself in a supportive way, you can prepare yourself to cope with challenges and to do your best, even when things are difficult. If you think negatively, it can make you feel even more upset than you already were. You can learn to use self-talk when things go wrong and to be your own self-talk Superhero!; Now let’s see how Zip used his super power to help a kid named Lily!; Every night, Zip put on his mask and cape and flew to give advice and help to someone who was feeling down, frustrated, or needed help.; 
It was a Friday night. Lily had just created an epic lego tower covered in missile launchers. Her little sister, Monica, came over to check out Lily’s work and was so excited. “Wow, this is the coolest tower ever!” Without asking Lily for permission, Monica reached out to try launching the missiles and accidentally knocked over the tower, breaking the entire building. Lily watched all her hard work disappear in an instant. She could feel anger rising up inside her. At the same moment, the archenemy of superhero Zip who’s name is supervillain, Zap, was waiting in the shadows, and he cackled with delight when he saw Lily’s frustration. This was his chance! Zap’s evil power is planting seeds of doubt and fear in children’s minds and tricking them into telling themselves hurtful and unsupportive things. Once Zap has tricked a child into undermining themselves, they start to do his evil work for him. When he saw Lily’s anger, he saw a perfect opportunity. He flew to her shoulder and whispered quietly in her ear:; 
""You spent so long building your legos and she just ruined it! She never respects your things. You should scream at her to teach her a lesson. Why should you always be the one to stay calm? You should throw a fit because you are so mad! She made you feel bad, so you deserve a chance to make her feel bad, too"". Lily’s face began to turn red. Zap saw Lily was getting really angry. He heard her muttering to herself, “I should make her feel bad.” Once Zap heard that he had tricked her into negative self-talk, he gleefully flew away. 
Let’s take three deep breaths together with Lily to help her feel calm. Let’s count together, ready, one breath; [pause]; two breath; [pause]; three breath; [pause];
 Zap continued, “Now let's try some supportive self-talk. and see how it can help you.;
First, notice how you feel right now, and remind yourself that no matter how you’re feeling, it's ok to feel that way.;
[Q effect sound]; How do you think Lily feels?",na-4,"Sorry, I did not catch that. Can you say again?"
1,4,"Thanks for sharing, let’s see how Zip continued helping Monica to deal with her feeling. ;
Zip continued, “now feel that feeling and think about what kind of sister you want to be.” Monica said quietly to Zip, “I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister”. Zip replied, “That sounds like really good self-talk; do you want to try saying that to yourself three times?” Monica said out loud: ;
“I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister”;
“I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister”;
“I want to be a good sister and be a good friend to my sister”;
 “Great job,” said Zip. “So now what do you want to say to your sister after you accidently broke her lego?”;
Monica calmed down quite a bit now and she thought for a moment and said to Lily, “Sorry, I accidently broke your lego building. I know you are frustrated and sad. I hope I can do something for you. How about we work together to build another, how about let’s building the Star War air craft together!” ;
Lily’s angry emotion went away as soon as she heard that. She was happy to hear that Monica would love to join her to build another epic lego. She said yes and they spent the entire half of the day together building the legos and having fun. When Zip saw this, he happily flew away.;

[Q effect sound];
